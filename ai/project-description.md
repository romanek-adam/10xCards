Manual creation of high-quality educational flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages the use of the effective learning method that is spaced repetition.

### Minimum Feature Set
- AI flashcard generation based on input text (copy-paste)
- Manual flashcard creation
- Viewing, editing, and deleting flashcards
- Simple user account system for storing flashcards

### What is NOT included in the MVP scope
- Custom, advanced repetition algorithm (like SuperMemo, Anki)
- Import of multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Sharing flashcard sets between users
- Integrations with other educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web only)

### Success Criteria
- 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by the user
- Users create 75% of flashcards using AI
